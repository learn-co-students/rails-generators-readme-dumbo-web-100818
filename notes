rails generate <name of generator> <options> --no-test-framework

tells rails to generate what you tell it without any tests

Migration Generator
cuts down migration creation, column addition/removal to one line; changing column datatypes or names requires manual change. 

Model Generator
generates a model and database with minimal code bloat

Controller Generator
generates everything needed and more (code bloat)

rails g resource Account name:string payment_status:string --no-test-framework --> creates an app with full crud but without code bloat (no views files or filled in code in the controller, sets up resources aka paths for controller and views)
